# Secure-Text-Sharing
In the "Secure Text Sharing Python GUI Project," we aim to create a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) application that facilitates secure and encrypted text sharing between users. This project utilizes Python along with GUI libraries such as Tkinter for the frontend and cryptography modules for encryption and decryption processes.
